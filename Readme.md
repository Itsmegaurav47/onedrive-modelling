# Formal Modeling and Authorization Oracle for OneDrive (Personal Edition)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the formal model and Python implementation of an authorization oracle for Microsoft OneDrive's access control system (Personal Edition). The model uses a Capability-Based approach (Link-Mediated Access Model - LMAM) to capture sharing links, hierarchical inheritance, Personal Vault security, and state transitions. The oracle simulates access decisions (GRANT/DENY), and a comprehensive test suite validates the implementation.
